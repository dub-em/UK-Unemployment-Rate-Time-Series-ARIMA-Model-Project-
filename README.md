# UK Unemployment Rate Time Series ARIMA Model Project

## Project Overview
+ This project focuses on gathering time series data, transforming the data, building a suitable ARIMA model for the data, forecasting future values using the built model, and comparing this forecast with the real world outcome. The purpose of the project is to bridge the gap between the theories taught in the classroom setting with real world applications.

+ The Annual Unemployment Rate of the United Kingdom (UNRTUKA) was selected for this project. This series was constructed by the Bank of England as part of the Three Centuries of Macroeconomic Data project by combining data from a number of academic and official sources. The periodic range of the dataset is from the year 1760 to 2016. The Gretl Software was used for this project.
